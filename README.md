Uses [PlotDevice](http://plotdevice.io).


### Installation

- Download [PyYAML](http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML) (the zipfile is fine).
- Unpack it.
- Copy the `yaml` directory (inside of `lib`) into `~/Library/Application Support/PlotDevice` or the same directory as these files (per [the manual](http://plotdevice.io/tut/Libraries)).


### Tweaking

As an example of reordering the cases, see `latin-pronouns-alternate.pv` and `data-alternate.yaml`.
